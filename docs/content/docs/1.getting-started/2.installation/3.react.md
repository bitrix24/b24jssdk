## Examples

### B24Frame :badge{label="client-side" class="align-text-top"}

On the application page integrated into the Bitrix24 interface, you need to use the `B24Frame` object.

It is initialized on the client side using `initializeB24Frame()`.

Here is a complete example of how to organize everything on the application page.

```ts [some-page.jsx]
// @todo
```

### B24Hook :badge{label="server-side" class="align-text-top"}

To work with Bitrix24 from a standalone server-side application, use the `B24Hook` object.

```ts [server-side.ts]
// @todo
```

### B24OAuth :badge{label="server-side" class="align-text-top"} :badge{label="authentication" class="align-text-top"}

To work with Bitrix24 from a standalone server-side application, use the `B24OAuth` object.

```ts [server-side.ts]
// @todo
```
